# myFirstWebpage

A simple Sinatra application for teaching young kids basic HTML. The application provides a form and series of textblock fields that kids can fill out with basic text in a generator pane, and view the real-time updates in a preview pane. Kids can also insert HTML tags in the textboxes and see how different tags impact the results. 

The goal here isn't to teach kids how to create an entire page from scratch, but for them to learn some tags and how they impact the overall DOM. After learning a few basic tags, kids should move on to creating pages from scratch, with a dabble of CSS and Javascript!
